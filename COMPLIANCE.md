# AGPLv3 Compliance

Kypello is free and open source software developed for the community. All usage of Kypello is strictly subject to the terms of the GNU AGPLv3 [license](https://github.com/kypello-io/kypello/blob/master/LICENSE).

### Community Edition Only
Kypello is a pure open-source project. Unlike the upstream provider, **Kypello does not offer a commercial license exception.** There is no paid alternative to bypass the obligations of the AGPLv3.

If you choose to use Kypello, you must comply with the AGPLv3 requirements, including the obligation to share source code if you modify the software and provide it to users over a network (the "SaaS loophole" clause).

### Legal Responsibility
The Kypello maintainers cannot make the determination as to whether your application's usage of Kypello is in compliance with the AGPLv3 license requirements. You should rely on your own legal counsel or licensing specialists to audit and ensure your application is in compliance.

We understand that AGPLv3 licensing is complex. We strongly encourage using experts in licensing to make any such determinations around compliance. Applications using Kypello without validating their usage do so at their own risk.
