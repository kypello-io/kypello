# Vulnerability Management Policy

This document formally describes the process of addressing and managing a
reported vulnerability that has been found in the Kypello server code base,
the Kypello UI, or any direct/indirect dependency of the code base.

## Scope

The vulnerability management policy described in this document covers the
process of investigating, assessing, and resolving a vulnerability report
opened by a Kypello maintainer or an external third party.

It lists pre-conditions and actions that should be performed to
resolve and fix a reported vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Management Process

The vulnerability management process requires that the vulnerability report
contains the following information:

- The component that contains the reported vulnerability (e.g., Core Server, Console UI, KES).
- A description of the vulnerability. In particular, the type of the
  reported vulnerability and how it might be exploited. Alternatively,
  a well-established vulnerability identifier (e.g., CVE number) can be
  used.

Based on the description mentioned above, a Kypello maintainer or security team
member investigates:

- Whether the reported vulnerability exists.
- The conditions required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The steps required to fix the vulnerability.

### Resolution Paths

1.  **Kypello-Specific Code:** If the vulnerability exists in code unique to Kypello (such as the restored OIDC logic or Console UI), we will implement a fix, verify it, and release a new binary.
2.  **Upstream Code:** If the vulnerability exists in the core MinIO logic inherited from upstream, we will verify if an upstream patch is available.
   *   If available: We will cherry-pick the fix immediately.
   *   If not available: We may implement a temporary mitigation until the upstream project releases a fix.

In general, Kypello aims to resolve valid security reports by patching the codebase
or implementing reasonable countermeasures such that the vulnerability cannot be
exploited.
